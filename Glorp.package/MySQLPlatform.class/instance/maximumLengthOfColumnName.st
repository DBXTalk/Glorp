maximumLengthOfColumnName
	"^<Integer> I return the maximum length of a column name.  (I am not sent at present;  I am here so that if I and #maximumLengthOfTableName (which is sent) should ever differ on some database platform, I can be used in revised truncation logic.)
	Don't know the answer for this platform;  make something large up."
