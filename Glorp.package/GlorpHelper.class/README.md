This is a helper class for methods that I'd like to be able to add as extensions, but don't want to for fear of conflicting with dialects that have them, or people who implement them for their own projects, and any other miscellaneous extensions. One extension is that this class is in the Smalltalk namespace, so is universally accessible, and it provides a way for class extensions that don't have visibility of the Glorp namespace to access the Dialect class.
