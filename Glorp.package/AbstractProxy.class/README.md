This is an abstract superclass for proxy objects. It inherits from ProtoObject, which is part of the platform specific layer, but implements most of the proxy functionality.

Instance Variables:
	isInstantiated	<Boolean>	Has this proxy been instantiated or not.
	value	<Object>	What we are proxying for.
