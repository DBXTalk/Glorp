This is a query that contains several sub-queries, and executes them all in sequence, returning the concatenation of all the results. This is different from a CompoundQuery, which groups multiple queries together according to operations like UNION ALL, or INTERSECT. This just puts together several different queries and executes them separately, combining the results in Smalltalk. CompoundQuery is more powerful, and can take advantage of database features, but this is more flexible.
