This isn't really an expression, in that it can never occur due to parsing. It's a way of grouping several expressions together so that we can process them together, essentially making sure that the iteration methods will loop over all the expressions, but only do each node once, even if it occurs in multiple expressions.  This is used in processing order expressions to figure out what tables and join expressions we need.

Because it is only used in transient ways, it probably doesn't implement all the required operations for normal expression usage.
