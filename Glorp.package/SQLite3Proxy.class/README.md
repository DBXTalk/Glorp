SQLiteProxy is different from a normal proxy in that its >>glorpTriggerProxyAction: method passes back the result of the block, which the >>getValue method reassigns to the originally retrieved #value inst var. The idea is to have a proxy that represents a DatabaseField, when there is no such entity in any SQLite schema table, so it must be constructed from a variety of special SQLite3 function calls (called pragmas).
