This is a system for testing variable relationships. That is, where we have a relationship that might be one type of object, or might be another, depending on some criteria. The objects are not related by inheritance. Our example is a relationship to images, where if the images are small we retrieve them directly, but if they are larger we only retrieve minimal information about them.3
