"SQLite allows multiple processes to have the database file open at once, and multiple processes can read the database at once.  Thus we let that platform return true to #supportsMultipleOpenCursors.  When a process wants to write, it must lock the entire database file for the duration of its update (normally a few milliseconds, during which other processes wait on the writer to finish, then continue).  However this database locking is therefore dependent on the OS file-system and can show issues.  This test, after passing all its assertions, has been seen to fail in tearDown's rollback of the transaction due to 'database is locked'.  The presumption is that both cursors rollback and so appear like competing writes even though neither is really.   Releasing the cursors ends contention and lets the rollback succeed."
