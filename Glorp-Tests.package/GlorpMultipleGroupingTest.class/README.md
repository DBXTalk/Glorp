Previously, grouping in Glorp Queries only accepted a single expression. It is of course easy to write a multiple groupBy: that would return conflicting values for one of the returned fields.  (When run, this raises an error demanding omission or aggregation of that field.)  Except for this need for greater care in relating the query groupings to the data searched and the fields/aggregates requested for retrieval, multiple groupings are very like multiple orderings.  The facility has therefore been added.
